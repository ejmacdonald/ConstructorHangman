# ConstructorHangman

This node program presents the user with one of 6 sitcom names from the 80's and 90'3.  This user has a limited number of guesses to fill in the name of the sitcom, a'la hangman style.

I've fixed the number of guesses to the number of letters in the name PLUS 5 additional guesses.  

This code does not require the user to specify capital letters, for Seinfeld, for example, the user can type in a lower case s and the software will work fine.
